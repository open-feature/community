## Roadmap

The project roadmap is available [here](https://github.com/orgs/open-feature/projects/1).
New initiatives require an accepted [OpenFeature Enhancement Proposal (OFEP)](https://github.com/open-feature/ofep). A community decision will then be made as documented in [Decision Making](./governance-charter.md#decision-making).

## License

All OpenFeature projects are shipped under the permissive [Apache License v2](./LICENSE) as CNCF IP Policy dictates. [This blog post](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2017/02/01/cncf-recommends-aslv2/) explains the reasoning behind choosing this license.

## Associated Components and Implementations

The OpenFeature specification defines abstractions and interfaces for the purposes of flexibly integrating with various feature flag management systems, as well as with tools related to feature flag evaluation (such as telemetry and logging). In order to maintain [neutrality and no/low dependencies](https://github.com/open-feature/spec#design-principles), implementations of these abstractions should not be included in SDKs. Such implementations may exist in the "contribs" repository for their respective language (ie: https://github.com/open-feature/node-sdk-contrib) or in other repositories not owned by the OpenFeature organization. We recommend implementations be open source, but that's not a requirement.

## Adopters
