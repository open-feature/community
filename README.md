## Roadmap

The project roadmap is available [here](https://github.com/orgs/open-feature/projects/1).
New initiatives require an accepted [OpenFeature Enhancement Proposal (OFEP)](https://github.com/open-feature/ofep). A community decision will then be made as documented in [Decision Making](./governance-charter.md#decision-making).

## Contributing

All contributors are welcome!
Please see the contributing guidelines
[here](https://github.com/open-feature/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Contributing Prerequisites (DCO)

The [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) requires all pull requests are signed off using [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/dco).
By submitting pull requests, submitters acknowledge they grant the [Apache License v2](./LICENSE) to the code and that they are eligible to grant this license for all commits submitted in their pull requests.

## Associated Components and Implementations

The OpenFeature specification defines abstractions and interfaces for the purposes of flexibly integrating with various feature flag management systems, as well as with tools related to feature flag evaluation (such as telemetry and logging). In order to maintain [neutrality and no/low dependencies](https://github.com/open-feature/spec#design-principles), implementations of these abstractions should not be included in SDKs. Such implementations may exist in the "contribs" repository for their respective language (ie: https://github.com/open-feature/node-sdk-contrib) or in other repositories not owned by the OpenFeature organization. We recommend implementations be open source, but that's not a requirement.

## Governance

OpenFeature is a CNCF sandbox project. The project follows [CNCF recommended governance practices](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/governance/).
