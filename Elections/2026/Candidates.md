I've seen firsthand the challenges enterprises face when adopting feature flagging standards, which drives my passion for making OpenFeature more accessible and practical for real-world use cases. Beyond code contributions, I'm committed to growing our community through public speaking and sharing knowledge through blog posts.

Embracing a "chop wood, carry water" philosophy, I contribute to the project through both code and process design. I will apply this blend of enterprise product strategy and hands-on technical expertise to navigate flagd 1.0 readiness, ensure multi-language reliability, and drive sustained community growth.

### Weyert de Boer
- Company: [FNZ](https://www.fnz.com)
- GitHub: [weyert](https://github.com/weyert)

I'm a software engineer at FNZ, where I continue to advocate for and implement OpenFeature as our feature flag solution. Since joining the Governance Board in 2023, I've been actively involved in the community by helping establish the Vendor Council Committee and facilitating meetings to strengthen ecosystem collaboration. I've spoken at meetups about OpenFeature, attended KubeCon 2025 London to connect with the community, and consistently promoted OpenFeature internally at FNZ.

I'm running for re-election because I believe OpenFeature is the solid, vendor-neutral solution the industry needs for feature flag management. I want to focus on expanding adoption and making OpenFeature the default choice for feature flags. I plan to continue growing the Vendor Council and ecosystem collaboration, while also improving the developer experience to keep OpenFeature accessible and easy to integrate. One of my goals is to help create resources and documentation that make it easier for developers to build compelling business cases for introducing feature flags and OpenFeature at their organizations. I'm also committed to creating more opportunities for community members to engage and shape the project's direction.

I'm excited about OpenFeature's future and look forward to helping the project reach its full potential.
